# Programming Assignment 4
## Author: Harley Phung
In this programming assignment, 
I created Indexes along with IndexesTest and 
MaptrixMap along with MatrixMapTest.

In Indexes, I created some private helper methods
* checkLengthOutOfBound(val): that check if the length is < 0 (out of bound)
* checkLengthOutOfBound(row, col): That check if row and col assigned is out of bound
* checkRow(): check if from and to indexes in order
* checkCol(): check if from and to indexes in order

In Matrix Map, I created some private helper methods
* checkSmallerThanZero(): check if arguments are out of bound
* checkException(): check if there's exception
* checkSize(): check if size is out of bound
* checkRowAndCol: check if the row and col are out of bound
